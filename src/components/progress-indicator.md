# Progress Indicator

## Functionality

The progress indicator is a component indicating the progress of whole-page browsing. It increases as the page scrolls down and decreases when scrolling up.

## Visual Design

Visually, it resembles a timeline-based bar with the following features:

An icon (serving as the indicator mark) to represent current progress.
The icon is a vector image that can be dynamically updated throughout the process.
A solid-color background bar with scale markers as reference points.

## Interaction Features

Clickable segments: Each segment of the bar is clickable for quick navigation.
Real-time feedback: Progress updates synchronize with user scrolling or manual interactions.
